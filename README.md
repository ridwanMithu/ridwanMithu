## Hey!!! I am Ridwan.![enter image description here](https://img.shields.io/badge/A_developer-Who_wanders-blue)

I am a new developer, learning MERN stack as a hobby. I already have knowledge about following tools. Currently, deep diving to understand how things work on my own.

Yes, I have confusing learning targets. But this is due to my lack of experience. I will focus on things that will add more value to my career as a developer as I keep going. Just listing things for now so that I can easily pick things when I need.

## I love to test new tech

 1. I am super duper into AI image generation. Mostly, I love to break them and find ways to cough them pictures they don't want to create😉😜😏
 2. I am eagerly waiting for upcoming updates in #React, #CSS, #HTMX
 3. One other tool I am desperately waiting to tryout is #GitButler
